# Radar-ultrasonico

College project about IOT, digital electronic and hardware architecture which is about an ultrasonic radar that detects objects as it rotates driven by a servomotor. This is connected to the local network via wifi and then, in each 180 degree path, it sends the data found to a firebase database in which we could analize that information about the place where it was operated.
